Hello there, I'm Kenny. A Korean developer working in Sydney.

I've been working for 20 years on IT/Programming here, Tokyo and Seoul.
I'd like to share my recent learnings on the latest technology.

Stay tuned. The first coming post would be about setting a private VPN server on Oracle cloud.

BTW, I'm recently working with JS and loving it.
Still new to Ruby but love Jekill and Gihub.
Here is my little promise.

{% highlight JS %}
(async () => {
  const content = await setTheAlgoVpnOnOracleiCloud({
    region: 'SouthKoreaNorth',
    due: 'ASAP'
  });
  const post = await dumpTheWalkthrough({
    target: 'Github blog',
    author: 'kennyhyun',
    content
   });
  await publishContents(post);
  console.log('You can make your own private VPN server now');
})();
{% endhighlight %}

Head-ups:

- [Oracle Cloud][oracle-cloud]
- [Algo VPN][algo-vpn]

[algo-vpn]: https://github.com/trailofbits/algo


See ya
